Reactjs application build process
==================================

Install Node.js
---------------- 
Enable the NodeSource repository by running the following curl command as a user with sudo privileges:

$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

The command will add the NodeSource signing key to your system, create an apt sources repository file, install all necessary packages and refresh the apt cache.

If you need to install another version, for example 14.x, just change setup_12.x with setup_14.x

Once the NodeSource repository is enabled, install Node.js and npm by typing:

$ sudo apt install nodejs

The nodejs package contains both the node and npm binaries.

Verify that the Node.js and npm were successfully installed by printing their versions:

$ node --version

  v12.16.3

$ npm --version

  6.14.4
